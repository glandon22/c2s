I created this personal webiste as my first attempt to display some code. The site is built completely from scratch,
and is optimized for desktops and laptops. The site is not available for mobile yet, and will display strange functionality.

The website implements some CSS animations, along with jQuery (aside from standard HTML/CSS). There are links to other projects I 
have created and hosted on Heroku, and users are able to find my social media accounts or send me an email in the contact section.
